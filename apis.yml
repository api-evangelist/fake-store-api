      Fake Store API is a tool that allows users to access a database of fake
      products, customers, and orders. Users can use the API to generate test
      data for their e-commerce applications or to practice integrating with
      external APIs. The Fake Store API provides a simple and easy-to-use
      interface for retrieving information such as product details, customer
      information, and order history. By using this API, developers can simulate
      real-world scenarios and test the functionality of their applications
      without having to use actual data.
